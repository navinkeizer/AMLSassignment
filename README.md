# AMLSassignment
Applied Machine Learning Systems assignment 2018

This repository contains the code and supplemental files for the AMLS assignment. All code and files were produced by Navin Keizer.

The dataset folder contains the label file used in all experiments. The final version folder contains all final code used. This also includes the extra files and preprocessing files. The different pre processing files were used to asses different image processing methods.

The sublemental files folder contains the csv files produced by the code of the test data, as well as a word file with all the results noted down during the experiments. 

There is also a folder with extra_test results on the data provided by Professor Andreopoulos, which can be downloaded from the UCL Moodle website, and needs to be saved in the dataset/testing_dataset path. The code which was used to produce this data is final_model_to_csv.py.

In order to test run this code, the files need to preferably be important in PyCharm, with the same names etc.
